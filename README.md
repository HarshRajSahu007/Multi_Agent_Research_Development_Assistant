Multi-Agent Research and Development Assistant
Project Overview
Create an advanced multi-agent system that helps researchers and developers analyze scientific literature, experiment with implementations, and generate new research ideas across multiple modalities (text, code, images, diagrams).
Technical Components
1. Document Analysis Engine

Use PyTorch-based computer vision models to extract and classify figures, tables, equations, and diagrams from academic papers
Implement specialized OCR for mathematical notation and technical diagrams
Create a parsing system for different document formats (PDF, LaTeX, HTML research pages)

2. Multi-Level RAG System

Develop a hierarchical retrieval system with multiple knowledge bases:

Scientific papers database (embeddings of text + visual elements)
Code repository database (with function-level embeddings)
Experiment results database (for tracking your own findings)


Implement cross-modal retrieval that can find relevant information based on both textual and visual queries

3. Agent Ecosystem

Create specialized agents using LangChain:

Research Agent: Analyzes papers, extracts key findings, and connects related work
Implementation Agent: Writes code based on paper descriptions, evaluates algorithms
Experiment Agent: Designs and executes experiments to validate hypotheses
Critique Agent: Evaluates claims, identifies weaknesses, suggests improvements
Orchestrator Agent: Coordinates all other agents and manages the workflow



4. Visual Understanding System

Implement computer vision models that can:

Parse and understand complex scientific visualizations
Generate new visualizations based on research findings
Translate between different visualization types (e.g., convert tables to graphs)
Extract data points from charts for further analysis



5. Interactive Research Environment

Create a UI where users can:

Upload papers or paste links to be analyzed
Ask complex research questions
Request code implementations of papers
Generate experiment designs
Visualize connections between papers and concepts



Implementation Approach

Data Pipeline

Build a processing pipeline that can handle multiple document types
Extract and structure content (text, figures, tables, equations)
Store processed information in vector databases with appropriate metadata


Knowledge Integration System

Develop mechanisms to connect information across different sources
Create knowledge graphs representing research domains
Implement reasoning mechanisms to draw conclusions from disparate information


Agent Communication Framework

Design protocols for inter-agent communication
Implement a memory system that allows agents to share findings
Create evaluation metrics for agent performance


Continuous Learning Module

Design a system to incorporate user feedback
Implement mechanisms to update the knowledge base with new findings
Create personalization features based on researcher interests



Technical Challenges
This project presents several advanced challenges:

Integrating computer vision with NLP for multi-modal understanding
Creating effective coordination between multiple specialized agents
Handling the inherent uncertainty in research domains
Building reasoning systems that can work with partial information
Ensuring accurate cross-referencing between visual and textual elements
